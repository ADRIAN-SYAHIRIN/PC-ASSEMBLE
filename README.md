# PC-ASSEMBLE
First step to become computer science student

I'm curious what we have in pc....

The PC assembly workshop helped participants understand how each part of a computer works and how to put it together.

First look <3

I think i have to know the function of each component before start...

Motherboard: Connects all parts of the computer.
CPU (Processor): Does the thinking and calculations for the computer.
RAM: Stores data the computer is using right now.
Storage (HDD/SSD): Saves all your files and programs.
Power Supply: Gives power to the computer.
Graphics Card (GPU): Controls what you see on the screen.
fan: Keeps the computer from overheating.

I knew very little about computer hardware before the computer assembly workshop. I was able to close the knowledge gaps and gain a better understanding of how a computer operates thanks to this class. Thank you so much to everyone who helped make this workshop a success. PS: Take a look at the images below.
